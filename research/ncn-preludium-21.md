During my PhD studies in Adam Mickiewicz University I was principal investigator of the Polish National Center of Science grant 2022/45/N/ST1/02814 PRELUDIUM. 

<p class="text-bold text-underline"> Title of the project </p>
<p> Topological robotics: topological complexity of K(G,1) spaces and effective topological complexity</p>

<p class="text-bold text-underline"> Duration </p>
<p>24 months</p>

<p class="text-bold text-underline"> Hosting Institution </p>
<p>Adam Mickiewicz University</p>

<p class="text-bold text-underline"> Short description </p>

<p>In this project I studied different aspects of the relationship between groups and topological complexity (TC) and related category-like invariants. The approach was on two different fronts:</p>

<ul class="list-objectives-NCN">
<li>The study of (sequential) topological complexity of spaces of type K(G,1) for G a torsion-free discreet group, and of sectional category of fibrations between K(G,1) spaces that are induced by subgroup inclusions.</li>

<li> The study of how symmetries (mathematically encoded as group actions) can help in reducing the complexity of the motion planning by investigating the properties of  an equivariant version of the classic TC, called effective topological complexity.</li>
