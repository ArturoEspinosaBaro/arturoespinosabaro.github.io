Hello, I am Arturo! Since October 2025 I am an assistant professor (Post Doc) at the [Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences](https://impan.pl/pl/) (IM PAN) in Warsaw, under Piotr Nowak. Previously, I completed my PhD at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science of Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan, under the supervision of Wacław Marzantowicz. 

In this site you can find my contact information, a bit about my research, details about my previous funding and also a link to my CV.
