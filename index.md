Since October 2025 I am an assistant professor (Post Doc) at the [Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences](https://impan.pl/pl/) (IM PAN) in Warsaw, under Piotr Nowak. Previously, I completed my PhD at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science of Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan, under the supervision of Wac≈Çaw Marzantowicz. 

In this site you can find my contact information, a bit about my research, details about my previous funding and also a link to my CV.
